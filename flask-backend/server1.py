It has many similarities to laryngeal carcinoma, one of the three most common cancers among males in the city, with an age standardized rate of 8.6. The associated risk factors of laryngeal carcinoma i.e. smoking, paan, betel nut usage and alcohol use also tend to be concentrated in the same demographic background as that of TB, creating a diagnostic dilemma. We present a case of granulomatous laryngeal TB, in a 40 year old male, with characteristic presenting features of laryngeal carcinoma i.e. persistent hoarseness and weight loss. He had no associated symptoms of fever, night sweats, cough or dysphagia, nor did he have any history of tobacco or irritant use. There was no history of tuberculosis (TB) contact. He was initially worked up for laryngeal carcinoma; however laryngoscopic biopsy revealed laryngeal TB. We present this case to emphasize the point that although primary laryngeal tuberculosis is a rarity, it must not be overlooked as a possibility when evaluating dysphonia and/or considering laryngeal carcinoma.",

Untreated latent TB infection is more likely to advance to TB disease in people with HIV than in people without HIV. In people with HIV, TB disease is considered an AIDS-defining condition. AIDS-defining conditions are infections and cancers that are life-threatening in people with HIV. Treatment with HIV medicines is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).

The prevalence of DM is increasing faster where TB is endemic already. Unfortunately, these are the regions in the world where health care facilities are less common. According to International Diabetes Federation, the 50-55% increase in the prevalence of DM over the next 2 decades will occur predominantly in the continent of Africa (10). A longitudinal, multi-national study involving low-income countries concluded that an odds ratio of 4.7 for prevalence and 8.1 for incidence of TB is highly likely in those counties where DM has increased over the last decade (13).",

TB symptoms are similar to symptoms of other diseases that occur more often in people with HIV. In addition, people with HIV are more likely to have TB in parts of the body other than the lungs. These forms of TB are called extrapulmonary TB. Extrapulmonary TB can affect the lymph nodes, abdomen, brain, bones, and other parts of the body. Extrapulmonary TB can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are not specific to TB. The diagnosis of TB in people with HIV is based on a combination of medical history, physical examination, chest X-ray, and laboratory tests. The most common laboratory test for TB is the sputum test. The sputum test is used to detect TB bacteria in the lungs. The sputum test is not always accurate in people with HIV. Other tests for TB include the tuberculin skin test, the interferon-gamma release assay, and the chest X-ray. These tests are used to detect TB bacteria in the body.
